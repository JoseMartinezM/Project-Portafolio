# Biometric Identification System for Hospitals

## Project Description

This project involves creating a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a biometric identification system specifically designed for hospitals. The primary goal is to enhance efficiency and security in medical care through the use of advanced biometric technologies, such as fingerprint identification and iris recognition.

## Purpose

The purpose of the biometric identification system is to:
- Streamline patient and staff access to the hospital.
- Eliminate the need for manual identity verification.
- Optimize the patient flow within hospital facilities.

## Scope

The system provides the following functions:
- **Rapid and Accurate Identification**: Utilizes biometric data such as fingerprints and iris recognition.
- **Identity Verification**: Ensures the authenticity of medical and administrative staff.

System limitations:
- **Possibility of False Positives or Negatives**: Biometric recognition is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.
- **Independent Database**: Biometric data is stored in a separate database from medical records.

## Target Audience

- **Patients**: Secure and easy access to hospital areas without manual registration.
- **Hospital Staff**: Streamlined access to the hospital through biometric identification.
- **High-Level Staff**: Quick access to restricted areas of the hospital.
- **Administrators**: Management of the database, system efficiency, security, and access records.

## Standards and References

This SRS document follows the standards established by:
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017**: Systems and software lifecycle processes.

## General Description

This document contains all the necessary information for implementing the biometric identification system, including:
- Explanation of relevant theoretical concepts.
- Detailed description of system requirements.
- System limitations, dependencies, and assumptions.
- UML diagrams for better understanding.

## Key Concepts

### User Requirements

User requirements are detailed specifications of what users expect from the system:
- **Functional**: System behavior based on user interaction.
- **Non-Functional**: Quality attributes the system must meet.

### System Requirements

- **Extended Requirements**: Detailed descriptions of how the system meets user requirements.

### Requirements Specification

Includes both user and system requirements, following traditional models like the SRS.

### UML Diagrams

Visual tools used to exemplify and depict system requirements, including:
- **Use Case Diagrams**: Interaction between people.
- **Activity Diagrams**: Process flow.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Process flow with timelines.
- **State Diagrams**: State changes in system objects.
- **Class Diagrams**: Methods and attributes of objects.

## Glossary

- **Biometric Authentication**: Verification technique based on biological characteristics.
- **Biometric Data**: Unique information related to physical or behavioral characteristics.
- **Database**: Organized system for storing information.
- **Stakeholders**: Individuals or organizations involved in and affected by project decisions.
- **User**: Individual or group interacting with the system.
- **UML Diagram**: Standardized visual representation used to describe the structure and behavior of systems.

## Product Features

- **Biometric Identification** of patients and staff.
- **Authorization Levels Assignment** for critical areas.
- **Access Records Generation** based on biometric identification.

## Constraints

- **Availability of Biometric Hardware**: The system depends on identification devices such as fingerprint readers and iris recognition cameras.
- **Compliance with Privacy Regulations**: Adherence to health data privacy laws.
- **Cybersecurity**: Implementation of robust measures against cyber threats.
- **Staff Training**: Necessary for effective system implementation and use.

## Dependencies

- **Uninterrupted Availability of Biometric Hardware**.
- **Cooperation of Various Departments** for system integration.
- **Integration with Other Systems and Components** of the hospital infrastructure.

## Needs Allocation

Needs allocation ensures that resources are efficiently assigned and that the system features align with the needs and requirements of each hospital.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive solution for biometric identification in hospitals, improving security and efficiency in patient and staff access while complying with industry standards and regulations.
