# Network Reengineering Project for Tecnológico de Monterrey, Guadalajara Campus

## Overview

This project focuses on the network reengineering of the student dormitories at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Guadalajara Campus. The primary goal is to upgrade the existing network infrastructure for sensors and cameras from analog to IP-based systems. This transition is essential for modernizing the campus's technological infrastructure, improving the efficiency and quality of surveillance, and ensuring seamless integration with the existing campus network.

## Project Objectives

- **Modernize Technological Infrastructure:** Implement an IP-based network for sensors and cameras in the dormitories, replacing outdated analog systems. This upgrade will provide greater flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in surveillance and monitoring.
  
- **Enhance User Experience:** Provide high-quality Wi-Fi connectivity for residents and visitors, ensuring adequate coverage and optimal performance across all residential areas. This includes adding additional access points to meet the increased demand during special events.

- **Ensure Security and Controlled Access:** Implement advanced access control and detection systems to ensure the security of the dormitory facilities, effectively manage access, and centralize the management of entry and exit points.

## Problem Statement

The current technological infrastructure in the dormitory facilities is outdated, posing several challenges that affect both the safety of residents and the quality and availability of internet services. The main issues identified include:

- **Insufficient Internet Coverage:** The existing Wi-Fi access points are inadequate to support the growing number of connected devices, affecting residents' ability to access online services and complete academic work.

- **Outdated Analog Technology:** The current network's analog infrastructure does not allow for easy and cost-effective expansion. Upgrading surveillance coverage or internet service involves high costs and significant technical challenges.

- **Limited Video Storage and Access:** The analog system limits storage capacity and ease of access to video recordings, leading to degradation in video quality over time and making event retrieval slow and cumbersome.

- **Inability to Utilize Advanced Technologies:** The current infrastructure cannot leverage new real-time video analysis technologies and advanced network services that could significantly improve event detection and internet service quality.

## Solution Proposal

To address these challenges, the project proposes:

- **Detailed Analysis of Requirements:** A thorough evaluation of the current and future needs for the sensor, IP camera, and Wi-Fi networks within the dormitories.

- **Design of Sensor and IP Camera Network:** A comprehensive design that includes network topology, device placement, and integration with the existing infrastructure.

- **Wi-Fi Infrastructure Design:** A solution to improve internet service coverage and quality, including the placement and configuration of access points (APs) and necessary switches.

- **Selection of Equipment and Materials:** A detailed list of required equipment and materials for implementing the network, including cameras, sensors, switches, access points, cables, and other components.

- **Economic Proposal:** A cost estimate for implementing the network, covering the cost of equipment, materials, and installation.

- **Bandwidth Solution:** Ensuring that the network can handle the expected load, with considerations for peak usage times and different service demands, from basic internet browsing to high-bandwidth activities like online gaming and HD streaming.
