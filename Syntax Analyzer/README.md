# Syntax Analyzer

## Overview

The Syntax Analyzer is a tool developed in Python to analyze the grammatical structure of a source code program. It uses a predefined set of grammar rules to parse the code and generate a syntax tree, which visually represents the structure of the program.

## How It Works

The Syntax Analyzer operates through the following key components:

### 1. Tokenizer
The Tokenizer utilizes regular expressions to break down the source code into meaningful tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuation marks. These tokens serve as the basic building blocks for further analysis.

### 2. Syntax Analyzer
The Syntax Analyzer applies a set of grammar rules to the tokens generated by the Tokenizer. It uses a bottom-up parsing approach to construct a syntax tree. This tree represents the hierarchical structure of the program, where each node corresponds to a grammatical element like a statement, expression, or operator.

### 3. Node Class
The Node class defines the structure of the syntax tree nodes. Each node contains a type, an optional value, and can have multiple child nodes. These child nodes represent nested grammatical elements within the program.

## Error Handling

The Syntax Analyzer is equipped with error detection mechanisms. If the input code contains syntax errors, the analyzer generates detailed error messages that specify the nature and location of the errors. These messages help in identifying and correcting the issues within the source code.
