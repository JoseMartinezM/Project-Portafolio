Project Overview
This project was developed in collaboration with Wizeline, a global technology services provider that builds high-quality digital products and platforms. The goal was to create a dynamic web page that showcases a graph displaying the 50 most used AIs. The page allows users to filter these AIs by category and pricing model (free or paid).


Features

Technologies Used

HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.

CSS: For styling and enhancing the user interface.

JavaScript: For adding interactivity and handling data visualization.
